# Objective
Use the [sample application here](http://computer-database.herokuapp.com/computers) 

1. Create and document manual test cases that cover all of the CRUD functionality of the app, plus any edge cases you can think of.  Make sure you include detailed instructions for testing each case. (pre-conditions, steps to reproduce, and expected results).  You can use any documentation format you like.

2. Write automation scripts that can be run against the application  that automate your manual test cases.  These scripts would be included in a regression test set.  Please use whatever language or tool you prefer, except for test recording frameworks.

3.  When you're finished with steps 1 & 2, please push your documentation and test scripts to GitHub and send a link to matt.marooney@transport4.com
