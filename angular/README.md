# Objective

1. Create a simple "Taco Recipe" application. 

2. Use the latest Angular Framework version.

3.  When you're finished, please push your code to GitHub and send a link to matt.marooney@transport4.com
 
# Application Requirements

1. Users of the application should be able to create a new Taco recipe consisting of:
    - A type of taco shell
    - A type of taco protein
    - Various additional toppings
    - A taco sauce of some kind
    - A name for their taco recipe
    - Instructions for cooking or assembling their taco

2. Users should be able to view a list of their taco recipes.

3. Users should be able to edit existing taco recipes.

4. Users should be able to delete taco recipes.

5. The application should use some sort of mock API backend to simulate REST service calls for persisting the taco data

6. The application should implement some method of "state" in a useful way (your choice).

7. The application should contain at least one "positive" unit test and one "negative" unit test.

8. Don't worry about making it look pretty, function is more valuable than form in this challenge.

9. EXTRA CREDIT: If you have time, implement a way to share the recipes on social media.
